            <h2>Mother to Son</h2>
            <h5>Langston Hughes</h5>
            <p> The poem follows a mother speaking to her son about her  life, which she says "aint't been no crystal stair". She first describes the struggles she has faced and then urges him to continue moving forward.It was referenced by Marling Luther King Jr. several times in his speeches during the civil rights movement, and has been analyzed by several critics,notably for its style and representation of the mother.
